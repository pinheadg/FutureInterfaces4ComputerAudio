motivated by a literature review of over 40 years of gesture based interactions.
This work presents a unique perspective on gesture-based
interactions, categorized in terms of four key elements: gesture styles, the application domains they are applied to, input technologies and output technologies used for
implementation.  The taxonomy provides a means of addressing
gestures as an interaction mode across the different application
domains so that researchers and designers can draw on the vast
amount of research that has been addressed within the literature
from an interaction perspective.}
