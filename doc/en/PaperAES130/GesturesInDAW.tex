\begin{abstract}
There is a noticeable absence of gestures---be they mouse-based or
(multi-)touch-based---in mainstream digital audio workstation (DAW)
software. As an example for such a gesture consider a clockwise O
drawn with the finger to increase a value of a parameter. The increasing
availability of devices such as smartphones, tablet computers and touchscreen
displays raises the question in how far audio software can benefit from gestures.
We describe design strategies to create a consistent set of gesture commands.
The main part of this paper reports on a user survey on mappings between 22~DAW
functions and 30~single-point as well as multi-point gestures.
We discuss the findings and point out consequences for user-interface design.

\section{Introduction}

In the last years, the concept of gesture became pervasive -- everyone in the western world either owns
at least one electronic device with gestural interface or knows someone who does. The mentioned devices
are most often portable. On non-portable devices, mainly personal computers (PC), the support of gestures
only recently began to win hearts and minds, as is the case with multi-touch gestures, or has been largely neglected,
as the situation with mouse gestures is.

Despite the circumstances described, many a power user took mouse gestures to his heart. The Opera web browser
introduced support of mouse gestures in April 2001\cite{WikipediaMouseGesture}, and this feature
had enough appeal for it's users to be reintroduced both to Mozilla Firefox (with -- currently -- more
than ten extensions\cite{FirefoxGestureExtensions}) and to Microsoft internet Explorer
(for example \cite{InternetExplorerGestures}) web browsers. Autodesk Maya, a 3D modeller software,
goes even further by using marking menus\cite{Kurtenbach:1994:ULP:259963.260376}, an input method related
to mouse gestures, by default.

But classic digital audio workstation (DAW) programs seem to shun gestures alltogether. Today,
most of the music software with gesture support runs on Apple iOS based platforms. A good example is
StepPolyArp\cite{StepPolyArp}, a MIDI arpeggiator software.
An additional event therein is created by touching an empty cell in the events grid\cite{StepPolyArpManual},
changing length of the event is done simply by dragging it, tap-and-hold and dragging afterwards is used to move the event
and to delete the event, the user places his finger upon the event and then swipes it down (akin to swiping a bead on an abacus).

Looking back to classic DAW software, there is a performance tool for Ableton Live software called Aggregat\cite{Aggregat}.
It is still under heavy development, but on the associated web page the developers provide a demonstration video.
Aggregat uses multi-touch capabilities at great lengths. The usual Ableton Live widgets are appropriately presented
on a touch-sensitive table. But aside from Aggregat, neither mouse gestures nor multi-touch gestures are used
in traditional DAW programs, and even single-touch gestures resemble nothing more than a mouse pointer.

The usual workflow when editing an audio document, as this is the main purpose of classic DAW programs, means chains
of edits. An edit means in this case the following sequence of steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Moving the cursor to the tool panel
\item Choosing the needed tool (through a menu or a button widget)
\item Moving the cursor back to the editing area
\item Performing an action with a tool
\item If the tool is destructive, most probably moving back to tool panel and \ldots
\item choosing a non-destructive tool
\end{enumerate}

Even without using quantification methods, such as GOMS\cite{Card:1983:PHI:578027}, it is evident
that the list above lasts much longer than a single gesture. In case the user tries to remedy the duration
of an edit through keyboard shortcuts, a gesture, especially on a touch screen, does not require to shift the user's
focus, at least occasionally, from screen to keyboard and back. Also, keyboard shortcuts require some time
and practice to become memorized. This is less true for gestures\cite{Appert:2009:USC:1518701.1519052}.

To conclude, which gestures are most appropriate for which functions of DAW software, we conducted
a survey among trained DAW users. First, we selected common DAW functions, performed repeatedly and often.
Second, we compiled a collection of gestures and selected 30 of them to appear in the survey. Then
we presented a bilingual survey to DAW users, who chose, which gesture does correspond to which DAW function
the most.

This paper is structured around the survey. The next section presents related approaches.
Section~\ref{sec:EditingTasks} discusses which audio editing tasks will be taken into the survey.
The section~\ref{sec:Gestures} describes available gestures and the process of their selection.
The main section~\ref{sec:Survey} discusses the survey itself. Eventually, the section~\ref{sec:Conclusions}
concludes this paper.

\section{Related work}

The differences between the mouse and the multi-touch interface, from which the differences between
the mouse gestures and multi-touch gestures will be expanded, were introduced in \cite{Buxton:1985:ITT:325334.325239}.
Such differences consist of 

A graphic similarity between mouse gestures and marking menus, as well several statements related
to gestures, were demonstrated in \cite{Kurtenbach:1993:LEP:164632.164977}.
The differences between mouse and multi-touch screen, contrary to differences between mouse input
and touch tablet, as it was in \cite{Kurtenbach:1993:LEP:164632.164977}, are discussed in
\cite{Forlines:2007:DVM:1240624.1240726}.

The taxonomy in \cite{ecs11149} helps to classify the groups of gestures observed in this paper.
A small taxonomy for multi-touch gestures is also provided in \cite{Wigdor:2010:ANU:1842993.1842997},
but it is directed towards surface input devices. Another taxonomy is presented 
n \cite{Wobbrock:2009:UGS:1518701.1518866}; also, this work has many useful observations,
some of which were seconded in the results of the survey.

When choosing gesture candidates for the survey, the paper \cite{Naumann:2007:IUU:1784197.1784212}
explains the concept of an ``intuitive'' gesture in a concise manner. The document \cite{Lee:2009:EEP:1520340.1520667}
helps to counter the overuse of gestures with inertial behaviour, as well as distinguishing between
the needs of mouse gestures and touch gestures. Another work that cautions against improvident use
of gestures is \cite{Norman:2010:GIS:1836216.1836228}.

The methodology of designing a gestural language using brainstorming is explained in
\cite{Akers:2007:ODM:1240866.1240868}. In a similar venue lies \cite{SalatBottomUpApproach}, which explains
the bottom-up approach to software design.

A design both of a gesture language and of a software package, which connects the gestures
as a replacement or an addition to applications written in Java programming language and using
its Swing toolkit, is presented in \cite{Appert:2009:USC:1518701.1519052}. The document also
provides a comparison between mouse gestures and keyboard shortcuts.

The paper \cite{Kammer:2010:TFM:1936652.1936662} describes formal description for multi-touch gestures,
which is also capable of producing formal descriptions of single-touch as well as mouse gestures.
