\begin{abstract}
Most current software that employs gestures -- be they mouse-based or (multi-)touch-based --
either runs on specific gesture-friendly platforms, in particular mobile phones, or uses gestures
to invoke only the most frequently used functions. There is, however, a noticeable absence of
gestures in mainstream DAW software. As an example for a potential such gesture consider
a clockwise O drawn with the finger to increase a value of a parameter. We investigate into
mappings between a dozen of typical gestures and DAW functions, examining the naturalness
from the users' point of view and pointing out commonalities and differences between mouse
gestures, single-touch gestures and multi-touch gestures. An outlook addresses accelerometer-based
and other nonclassical input devices.
